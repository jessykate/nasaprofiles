      <a class="faq" name="info">Where are you getting all of this information?</a>

    <div id="answer">
      <p>NASA has an servers which document every employee and guest registered into NASA's systems.  That's right, every single guest that visits a NASA center fills out some paperwork, and this is where it goes.  There is a field for every single visitor, and NASA keeps in on record for years. Of all the information NASA keeps on visitors and employees, there is only a few fields that NASA is allowed to make publicly available.  people.openNASA.com uses this public information to populate our database.  All additional information is given by the employee at their own discretion. </p>

      <a class="faq" name="public">So, all this information is publicly available?</a>

      <p>Yes, indeed.  See for yourself at <a href="http://people.nasa.gov">http://people.nasa.gov</a>.</p>

    <div id="question">
      <a class="faq" name="service">Is this a NASA service?</a>
    </div>
    
    <div id="answer">
      <p>No, this is not a NASA service.</p>

      <p>This is a private, non-government website.  Any material posted by civil servants or contractor personnel is done during off-duty, non-official time. The service itself is hosted on a private server and requires a NASA e-mail to edit the profile associated with the e-mail. As such, this service is not currently moderated. Additionally, since this is free, side-project service, your inquiries may take some time to be answered.</p>

    <div id="question">
      <a class="faq" name="why">Why did you create this service?</a>
    </div>
    
    <div id="answer">
      <p>There are approximately 120,000 people in the U.S. Space Program and this service is intended to help employees connect with each other.  Employees can search to find each other if they know they exist via the <a href="http://people.nasa.gov">traditional directory</a> (our internal directory doesn't have much more information), however we go a step further.  We provide a platform where employees can have a picture displayed, add in their current project they are working on, provide tags and skills, and list side projects they are working on. This information will help employees search for colleagues and collaborators they didn't even know they exist!  Also, this will help employees learn more about even their most frequent collaborators.</p>

      <p>This service is an experiment in transparency and accessibility of the NASA workforce for the NASA workforce. The developers and initiators of this service have only the highest intention and are committed to contributing to an open and honest workplace and allowing greater access within and into the the U.S. space program.</p>

      <p>This service has been desired for some time within NASA.  It took the <a href="http://www.sunlightlabs.com">Sunlight Labs</a> to provide leadership and encourage groups to host their own <a href="http://www.sunlightlabs.com/gah">Great American Hackathon</a> over the weekend of December 11-12, 2009. This project was started at that hackathon, and the first revision was released within two weeks.</p>

    <div id="question">
      <a class="faq" name="edit">How do I edit my profile?</a>
    </div>
    
    <div id="answer">
      <p>If you are a NASA employee (there no difference between a civil servant or a contractor here!), search for your profile and click on the link located under the map on the right hand side of your profile. After confirming that you are who you say you are, check your e-mail.  An e-mail will come from people@opennasa.com and will contain a link.  There is a one-time password stored inside the link and when you click the link you will be on your profile page to edit the fields in your profile.  As long as you keep your browser open, you will still be able to edit your profile.  Once you close your browser (or click on the 'logout' link in the footer), you'll need to repeat these instructions to edit your profile.</p>

      <a class="faq" name="account">Can I get an account?</a>
    </div>
    
    <div id="answer">
      <p>Nope.  There are no accounts here; this is not a social network.  If you want to edit your profile, please see the previous question.</p>

    <div id="question">
      <a class="faq" name="gravatar">How do I upload my picture?</a>
    </div>

    <div id="answer">  
      <p>For every employee at NASA, we have a picture taken of us.  Unfortunately (well, fortunately, really ... remember how the PIV photographer told you not to smile?) this picture is not publicly available.  We have elected to use a webservice called Gravatar to pull in a picture.  Gravatar is a "globally recognized avatar" which associates a picture (your "avatar") with an e-mail address.  Therefore, where ever you are on-line and logged in with an e-mail address, such as leaving a comment on a blog or contributing to a forum, your picture will follow you.  This is becoming increasingly popular with blogging software (and comes preshipped with WordPress) and is quickly being adopted with lightweight websites such as <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a>. To set up a Gravatar account, simply visit their <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/signup">website</a> and upload a picture to be affiliated with your primary e-mail address. Yes, you can have multiple pictures and multiple e-mail address.</p>

    <div id="question">
      <a class="faq" name="skills">What is the difference between Skills and Tags?</a>
    </div>
    
    <div id="answer">
      <p>A skill is a learned capacity that you have proficiency in.  This should be something that you can do with minimal effort and something that you would like your NASA community to know about you.  The more specific you can be, the better a NASA colleague can find you.  Another way to think about this, is through a scenario.  Let's imagine that you are in Phase B of a spacecraft project, and your instrument manager just told you that the operating temperature needs to be at -50C instead of -40C resulting in the need to change the structure material between your spacecraft bus and the instrument. You aren't a materials expert, and the two people you know in your branch doesn't have any ideas either.  So, you fire up people.openNASA and search for 'thermal' and 'structures' in the skills section.  Your skills should be relevant to aeronautics research and space exploration, so it isn't a place to tell other about your nunchuck skills.  Computer hacking skills, on the other hand, are very relevant.  So, what would you like to support your NASA colleagues with?</p>
      
      <p>A tag is a bit of information about you and your interests.  This should be something that you speak to a colleague about at the cafeteria or at a social function.  Your tags should still be relevant to aeronautics research and space exploration, so it isn't a place to tell us about your political theories -- unless they have to do with lunar governance.</p>

      <a class="faq" name="x500">What is x500 and LDAP?</a>
    </div>
    
    <div id="answer">
      <p>x500 is a computer networking standard for directory services.  LDAP (which stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an application protocol for searching and modifying directory services.  NASA uses x500 and LDAP as well as Active Directory, which is a Microsoft technology that provides LDAP and x500-like services and is where NASA is going for single sign-on.  When we mention "x500" we are referring to NASA stored employee information in a directory.  </p>

    <div id="question">
      <a class="faq" name="vcard">What is a vCard?</a>
    </div>
    
    <div id="answer">
      <p>vCard is a file formal for an electronic business card.  We don't have this implemented yet, but we'd like to.</p>
